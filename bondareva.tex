\section{Introduction}
 Before diving into the concept of balanced collections, balanced games and the Bondareva-Shapley Theorem, I want to establish a basic understanding of cooperative games, imputations and the core, mainly as it is described in Robert P. Gilles book \cite{gilles}, pp. 12--13, 18--20 and 29--35.

 \subsection{Cooperative Games and the Core}
 First we introduce a formal definition of the core.
\begin{defn}
    The pair $(N, v)$ is a \textit{cooperative game} if $N$ is a finite player set and $v: 2^N \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a characteristic function that assigns to every coalition $S \subset N$ an attainable payoff $v(S)$ such that $v(\emptyset) = 0$.
\end{defn}



 \section{Balanced Games and the Bondareva-Shapley Theorem}
 In the following chapter we will discuss the properties of cooperative games with a non-empty core and introduce the notion of balancedness, which leads us to the Bondareva-Shapley Theorem.

 \section{Market Games with nonempty cores}
 Market games can be proven to have a non-empty core using the Bondareva-Shapley Theorem. We will take a closer look on how this can be achieved in the third chapter.

 \section{Proving the Theorem using Linear Programming}
 Finally, we will show that the Bondareva-Theorem holds true with a prove using the Duality Problem in Linear Programming.
